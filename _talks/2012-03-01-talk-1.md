we propose a novel DTA prediction method named HeteroDTA. Specifically, a multi-view compound feature extraction module is constructed to model the atom–bond graph and pharmacophore graph. The residue concat graph and protein sequence are also utilized to model protein structure and function. Moreover, to enhance the generalization capability and reduce the dependence on task-specific labeled data, pre-trained models are utilized to initialize the atomic features of the compounds and the embedding representations of the protein sequence. A context-aware nonlinear feature fusion method is also proposed to learn interaction patterns between compounds and proteins. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that HeteroDTA significantly outperforms existing methods. In addition, HeteroDTA shows excellent generalization performance in cold-start experiments and superiority in the representation learning ability of drug–target pairs. Finally, the effectiveness of HeteroDTA is demonstrated in a real-world drug discovery study.
