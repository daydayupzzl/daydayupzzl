Education
======
* **Looking for PhD opportunities in AI for Medicine/Drug Discovery for Fall 2025**
* M.S. in School of Software, Henan University, Sep 2022 - Jun 2025
* B.S. in College of Information Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Sep 2018 - Jun 2022

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
======
* Enhancing generalizability and performance in drug–target interaction identification by
integrating pharmacophore and pre-trained models
  * First author, Oral presentation at ISMB 2024 [Nov 2023 - Feb 2024]
  * Developed HeteroDTA, a novel drug-target affinity prediction method that integrates multi-view compound feature extraction and pre-trained models to enhance generalization and reduce dependence on labeled data.
  * Achieved significant performance improvements over existing methods on public benchmark datasets and demonstrated effectiveness in real-world drug discovery studies.

* GraphkmerDTA: Integrating Local Sequence Patterns and Topological Information for Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction and Its Application in Multi-target Anti-Alzheimer’s Drug
Discovery
  * First author, Revised [Nov 2022 - May 2023]
  * Proposed a novel deep learning method, GraphkmerDTA, integrating Kmer features with structural topology to predict
drug-target binding affinity (DTA), outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.
  * Applied GraphkmerDTA in an AI-assisted network pharmacology strategy to discover key anti-Alzheimer’s disease
components from the Lonicera japonica flower, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in multitarget drug discovery

* ComNet: Enhancing Predictive Accuracy and Interpretability in Drug Combination Side Effects 
  * First author, Revised [Jul 2024 - Sep 2024]
  * A novel drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction model named ComNet is proposed, which improves the prediction
accuracy and reliability of complex drug interactions by combining multi-modal feature extraction, multi-scale subgraph
information fusion and multi-modal feature fusion mechanism.
  * Experiments on multiple shared data sets show that the model is superior to the existing model, and the practicability is demonstrated by case studies.

* Integration of AI-enhanced network pharmacology and experimental validation to reveal molecular mechanisms of multi-targets effects of Forsythia suspensa against Alzheimer's Disease
  * Co-author, Submission [Jun 2024 - Sep 2024]
  * Integrating network pharmacology, artificial intelligence, molecular docking, and wet-lab experiments to investigate the core components, relevant targets, and disease pathways associated with Forsythia suspensa in the context of anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activity.
  * Responsible for designing an AI-driven virtual screening protocol capable of predicting the affinity between individual traditional Chinese medicine compounds and thousands of AD-related targets within minutes and proposing a deep learning model named AlzNet, which combines graph neural networks with a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and further optimizes predictive performance using attention mechanisms. Ultimately, the pre-trained AlzNet model was employed to screen and rapidly identify potential broad-spectrum anti-AD candidates. This research strategy effectively harnesses the efficiency of artificial intelligence while integrating the reliability of traditional pharmacology, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of drug development.

LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE
======

- 2023 SICBC-AI Algorithms for Drug Screening
  - Team leader and developer [Jan 2024 - Present]
  - I formed a team to participate in a highly challenging drug screening competition targeting GluN1/GluN3A receptors. We
needed to identify hit compounds with high activity and specificity from a vast library of approximately 18 million
compounds. Utilizing drug-target affinity prediction models, we successfully identified a compound with an activity of
1.98μM. Out of all submissions, the organizers will select no less than 10 molecules per team, leading to about 1,000
molecules that will undergo high-throughput screening based on fluorescence signal changes. The top 100 active
molecules will then advance to the preliminary assessment phase. Our identified compound has been included in the top 100.

- Cloud-based intelligent AI drug screening platform
  - Team leader and developer [Sep 2023 - Present]
  - This project is dedicated to creating an intelligent drug screening platform using cloud computing, driven by
an advanced AI algorithm for drug-target affinity prediction. The platform integrates the collection and preprocessing of
small molecule drug libraries with AI-powered screening and molecular docking techniques. This approach significantly
boosts the efficiency and accuracy of drug discovery while cutting costs and development time.
