The First Global AI Drug Development Algorithm Competition is jointly organized by the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Baidu PaddlePaddle, and Lingang Laboratory, and is strongly supported by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association(CPA). The competition aims at exploring cutting-edge technologies in the field of AI-aided drug design, discovering outstanding talents, with the help of algorithmic advantages from Baidu PaddlePaddle in bioinformatics. We hereby cordially invite participants from universities, enterprises, and research institutions worldwide specializing in bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and related fields to join the competition.

The competition task focuses on topics such as small molecule drugs for COVID-19, aiming to encourage participants to apply artificial intelligence methods to discover potential drugs for the novel coronavirus. Participants may use deep learning, molecular docking, and other methods to predict and evaluate the interaction between small molecules and the main protease, as well as the potential of small molecules to inhibit virus replication in cells to explore potential drug candidates. Through this competition, we hope to promote innovation in drug development and provide strong support for future disease treatments and prevention efforts.
