In recent years, the cross-integration of artificial intelligence and biomedicine has attracted extensive attention. From academia to industry, from pharmaceutical companies, CROs to biotechnology companies, the exploration and application of AI technology in the industry is constantly strengthened and deepened. Nearly 1,000 AI pharmaceutical companies have been founded worldwide, driving the improvement of drug development efficiency. This is an opportunity for large IT and AI technology companies to enter the biomedical field on a large scale. So, can the application of artificial intelligence in biomedicine open a new path, leading to revolutionary breakthroughs in R&D productivity? On June 20-21, 2024, Shanghai hosted the 2024 Artificial Intelligence and Biomedical Ecology Conference (AIBC). The conference actively promotes the cross-integration of IT and BT, promotes exchanges and cooperation, and accelerates the development of biopharmaceutical related technology and industry.
