The International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Molecular Biology (ISMB) is an annual event hosted by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). As the flagship conference of ISCB, the conference is regarded as the largest bioinformatics and computational biology conference in the world. ISMB 2024 showcases the latest international advances in this field and drives future developments in this dynamic area of research. The conference mainly focused on intelligent systems in molecular biology, bringing together top scholars and researchers from around the world to share the latest research results and technological progress.

Oral presentation of accepted papers in English. An academic translation project developed during the second year of graduate school aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drug discovery through artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing technologies. The project is deployed and developed on Huawei's cloud platform, providing a range of application services. The platform has already achieved initial results in laboratory validation and demonstrated its great potential in drug discovery. In cooperation with students from the School of Business and the School of Pharmacy, I led the team to conduct in-depth research on market research, technology path and business model, participated in several large-scale professional competitions and achieved outstanding results.
